## Overview

This app allows users to easily:

* **Book a Court:** Select a court number (1-5) and a time slot for their desired play time.
* **Cancel Booking:** Manage existing reservations by specifying the court number and time slot.
* **Calculate Air Pressure (Placeholder):** Enter the weight of a basketball (in pounds) to get a recommended air pressure (placeholder functionality for future implementation).
